# ios-arm-code

These are Binary Files for iOS that I'm using to create a DMG for convenience [cough]

If you read the Private Post.. this was just easier since it works.

the client is a tftp client binary compiled by myself for iOS and arm7 and the how to use is:

usage: ./client [-p port] [-h hostname] -f filename

I compiled the code myself, copy pasta with a few edit and Cross Compile for iOS and its Signed with my Dev ID.

The other files are for convenience. At some point I hope this Repo will be more Kali-like.

binbag and the other files are for a convenience DMG, hit me up a pull request if you've got interesting source or other stuff to pull in for iOS Research and Reverse Engineering.

Updated on Jan 28, 2021 .. I'm in the process of cross compiling some basic applications for iOS / arm and signed with with my Developer ID

I'm posting them here to the Repo as I get time over the next few weeks..
