These are Binary Files for iOS that I'm using to create a DMG formconvenience [cough]

If you read the Privare Post, you know you want this file... its just easier since it workks..

the client is a ftp file and the how to is:

usage: ./client [-p port] [-h hostname] -f filename

I compiled the code myself, copy pasta with a few edit and Cross Compile for iOS and its Signed with my Dev ID.

The other files are for convenience. At some point I hope this Repo will be more Kali-like.

binbag and the other files are for a convenience DMG, hit me up a pull request if you've got interesting source or other stuff to pull in for iOS Research and Reverse Engineering.
