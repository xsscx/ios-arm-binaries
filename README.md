# ios-arm-binaries

These are Binary Files for iOS arm64e that I'm using to create a DMG for convenience [cough]

Notes on whats here for what isn't obvious.. 
the client is a tftp client binary compiled by myself for iOS and arm64e and the how to use is:

usage: ./client [-p port] [-h hostname] [-f filename]

I compiled the code myself, copy pasta with a few edit and Cross Compile for iOS and its Signed with my Dev ID.

The other files are for convenience. At some point I hope this Repo will be more Kali-like.

binbag and the other files are for a convenience DMG, hit me up a pull request if you've got interesting source or other stuff to pull in for iOS Research and Reverse Engineering.

I'm in the process of cross compiling some basic applications for iOS / arm and signed with with my Developer ID

Thee files are meant for just a few people.. if you've landed here and don't have a clear understanding on the background, probably best to move along.. nothing to see here... keep driving.. Abbots Lobster is just down the street to the Right in Noank...
